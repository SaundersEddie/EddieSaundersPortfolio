                        <h2 class="display-4">About</h2>
                        <p>I started coding way back in 1983, when the in thing was 6510A (6502) Machine Code on a
                            Commodore 64, after working on the Commodore 64 for many years I turned my attention to the
                            wonderful world of 16Bit and started
                            coding on the Commodore Amiga in 680x0 and the PC in 80x86. Over time I migrated away from
                            the gaming industry, the "crunch time" problems of people not leaving an office for days that had no
                            shower facilties
                            pushed me to move onto pastures new.</p>
                        <p> In 1998 I moved to the USA and started my career fresh, working in the IT field for UPS,
                            although I also looked after a small workforce managament group and done the odd bit of QA
                            type work on proprietary systems being
                            used at the time. 15 years later I had to opportunity to relocate to Cary, NC to work on
                            automation and human emulation projects for a company where I remained until 2019.</p>
                        <p>When my contract ended, I decided to take
                            a small break while considering where to go next, cue January 2020 when I decided to go
                            into Full Stack Web Development (really, this was my spouses idea, I think she wanted me to
                            do something other than gardening),
                            this was quite a leap considering the technologies and code were pretty much a red raw
                            reversal of what I'd been doing prior, we'll see where this leads.
